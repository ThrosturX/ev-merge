Large amounts of food must now be imported from First Centauri, along with the raw materials used in the factories which cover the face of the planet, churning out weapons and ships with which to fight the Voinians."	-1	""	0x0000	"EOR"
"desc"	129	"First Centauri"	"First Centauri was both the first world set foot on and the first colonised by mankind.

This treaty, however, while it has - arguably - ended all-out war, has not stopped the fighting - and a great deal of that fighting happens in the space outside Pax station."	-1	""	0x0000	"EOR"

Although for the average citizen interstellar travel is still expensive and unusual - even after nearly two centuries of space-flight, many on Earth never dream of leaving the homeworld - prices are steadily coming down, and New Rome is a favoured resort for once-in-a-lifetime space-travellers."	-1	""	0x0000	"EOR"

All the most revolutionary and brilliant designers reside here.

"desc"	170	"Huron"	"Huron is unique among UE colony worlds, having been independent of all major powers until it accepted the protection of the UE fleet after the Voinian War, by which it was barely affected. These days, the UE navy, taxed enough by the Voinian war, is hard-pressed to keep Huron defended from renegade raids, while the resources of Huron, considerable as it was able to grow and prosper while other worlds were subjected to the Voinian onslaught, continue to go towards fortifying the frontier."	-1	""	0x0000	"EOR"

Thanks to this cosmological quirk (and various bio-engineering techniques) the farms of Apollo are extremely productive. The moon is, however, currently suffering from renegade attacks, having recently been abandoned by the United Earth government, who lacked the resources to properly defend it."	-1	""	0x0000	"EOR"

"desc"	184	"Iothe Prime"	"Iothe Prime's founders included a large number of skilled technicians and engineers, who had pooled their skills and resources in order to leave Earth. The Voinian War did not touch this distant planet, and Iothe Prime attracted more colonists, maintaining a high-level of technical expertise despite constant renegade raids. Now the world is renowned for the the quality craftsmanship of all the goods it produces, and this is easily enough to tempt many traders to come here."	-1	""	0x0000	"EOR"

They developed shields far superior to Voinian heavy armour, guided weapons to which the Voinians É\nÉ had no counter,\nfast and manoeuvrable ships É\nÉ which the Voinians could not match.\n\nThen the Voinians threw all their forces at one point, which happened to be the Sol system.\n\nTheir fleet, as much to the humans' surprise as to the Voinians' own, was crushed. Buzzing mosquito fighters attacking from the asteroid belt, wolf-packs of destroyers surprising isolated Voinian hulks; one by one the impressive Voinian vessels were reduced to burnt-out wrecks.\n\nThe Battle of Sol was a triumph for mankind, especially since over a third of the Voinian fleet was destroyed during the conflict.\n\nThe tide of the war had turned.\n\nToday the Voinians are held back along a heavily defended frontier and United Earth forces match them shot for shot, raid for raid, offensive for offensive.\n\nBut mankind also has problems among its own: All united against the Voinians, and the United Earth government was formed. Now colonists who have never seen a Voinian ship are becoming restless. Their taxes are being spent to defend them from distant threats, their children go to fight a war that means nothing to them.\n\nAnd most of all they are ruled by a distant Earth government.\n\nElsewhere there are many areas of space that remain unexplored, and mankind remains oblivious to all the threats, and opportunities that lurk there.\n\nInto all this you are thrown.\n\nHaving graduated from the United Earth Naval Academy, you decline the opportunity to become just another fighter pilot, navigator, engineer or command officer, and set out to forge a destiny of your own.\n\nCaptain, the universe awaits you É"	-1	""	0x0000	"EOR"
